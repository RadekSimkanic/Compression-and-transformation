<h2>Transformations algorithms</h2>

<h3>Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (BWT)</h3>
Encoding and decoding strings. Been programmed to avoid wasting too much memory - is not using the rotation string, but use the rotation vectors.

<h3>Move to front (MTF)</h3>
Encoding string or list of chars to list of integers.
Decoding list of integers to string.
This transformation algorithm uses full ASCII stack.
