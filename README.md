<h2>Compressions algorithms</h2>
<h3>Run-length encoding (RLE)</h3>
Very simple compression algorithm.

<h2>Transformations algorithms</h2>

<h3>Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (BWT)</h3>
Encoding and decoding strings or lists with own alphabets. Been programmed to avoid wasting too much memory - is not using the rotation string, but use the rotation vectors.

<h3>Move to front (MTF)</h3>
Encoding string or list of chars to list of integers.
Decoding list of integers to string.
This transformation algorithm uses full ASCII stack.

<h3>Discrete Cosine transform (DCT)</h3>
Encoding and decoding list of numbers. - only 1D
